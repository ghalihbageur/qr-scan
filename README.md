## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I study how to make a good, clear code with HTML dan CSS. How to make a websiite with precision

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I will next to tailwind css. Before that, I will more practice how to make a clear code like profesional, because i think if the fundamental (html, css, js) is mastered, it will easier to I study framework. And I don't too rely on framework.

### Useful resources
